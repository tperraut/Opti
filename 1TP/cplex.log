Problem '11ex.lp' read.
Read time = 0.00 sec. (0.00 ticks)
Maximize
 Objectif: x1 + x2
Subject To
 sc1: x1 + x2 <= 4
 sc2: x1 - x2 >= 5
Bounds
 All variables are >= 0.
Implied bounds make row 'sc2' infeasible.
Presolve time = 0.00 sec. (0.00 ticks)
Presolve - Infeasible.
Solution time =    0.00 sec.
Deterministic time = 0.00 ticks  (1.26 ticks/sec)

Problem '21ex.lp' read.
Read time = 0.00 sec. (0.00 ticks)
Primal unbounded due to dual bounds, variable 'x2'.
Presolve time = 0.00 sec. (0.00 ticks)
Presolve - Unbounded or infeasible.
Solution time =    0.00 sec.
Deterministic time = 0.00 ticks  (1.33 ticks/sec)
